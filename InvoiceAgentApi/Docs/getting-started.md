Whether you’re a freelancer, a small business owner, or just someone who needs to keep track of payments from time to time, InvoiceApp makes it quick and easy to manage your invoices. You can create them in seconds, see which ones are paid or still pending, and stay on top of due dates.

## What You Can Do with InvoiceApp
- View all invoices in a single, easy-to-read list
- Create new invoices with just a few clicks
- Mark invoices as paid when you receive payment

## Example Use Cases
