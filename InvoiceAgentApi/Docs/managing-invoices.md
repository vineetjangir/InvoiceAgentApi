# Managing Invoices

Managing invoices in InvoiceApp is straightforward. You can track payments and keep your records up to date with just a couple of clicks.

## Updating the Payment Status
- **Mark as Paid** – Tick the checkbox in the Status column.
- **Mark as Pending** – Untick the checkbox to revert the status.

## Why Update the Status?
Keeping your status column accurate helps you know:
- Which clients still owe you money
- Which jobs are fully paid and complete
- When to send reminders

## Example Use Cases
- Mark an invoice as paid as soon as funds reach your account.
- Set an invoice back to pending if a payment is reversed or delayed.

## Gotchas
- There’s no “Are you sure?” message when changing status — be careful.
- Editing and deleting invoices isn’t available in the demo version. If you make a mistake, you’ll need to create a new invoice with the correct details.
- Status changes only affect what you see in the app — they don’t notify the client automatically.
