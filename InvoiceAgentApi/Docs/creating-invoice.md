# Creating an Invoice

The **Submit Invoice** page is where you add new invoices to your account. Creating an invoice only takes a minute.

## Steps to Create an Invoice
1. Click **Submit New Invoice** from the main page.
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Description** – a short name for what the invoice covers
   - **Amount** – enter the total in euros (e.g., 75.50)
   - **Date** – the date the invoice is issued (defaults to today)
   - **Due** – the payment deadline
3. Click **Submit** to save the invoice.
4. If you change your mind, click **Back to Invoices** to cancel.

## Example Use Cases
- Billing a client for design work
- Charging for a one-off job like garden maintenance
- Recording a payment owed between friends

## Gotchas
- Amounts should be entered without the euro symbol — just numbers and a decimal point.
- Make sure the due date is after the invoice date; otherwise, it may confuse clients.
- Once you save an invoice, you can’t edit it in the demo version.
